1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- First I Checked how many movies a specific user has watched.
- Then Plotted a bar chart of movie ratings.

2. Similarity Calculations:

- I Used Euclidean distance, Cosine similarity, and Pearson correlation to measure user similarities.

3. Recommendation System:

- Built a Top-Item Recommender by ranking movies based on ratings.
- Created a Collaborative Filtering Recommender by analyzing user-item rating similarities.

4. Additional Insights:

- I Explored patterns in user ratings.
- Used distance metrics to compare users and find similar movie preferences.

5. Conclusion:

- Summarized findings based on the analysis and recommendation results.
